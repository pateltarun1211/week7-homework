//==================Exercise #1 ==========//
/*Write a function that takes in the string and the list of dog names, loops through 
the list and checks that the current name is in the string passed in. The output should be:
"Matched dog_name" if name is in the string, if no matches are present console.log "No Matches"
*/
let dog_string = "Hello Max, my name is Dog, and I have purple eyes!"
let dog_names = ["Max","HAS","PuRple","dog"]

function findWords(arr, str){
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (str.toLowerCase().includes(arr[i].toLowerCase())) {
            console.log(`Matched dog_names`);
        } else {
            console.log("No match");
        }
    }
}

console.log(findWords(dog_names, dog_string))





//============Exercise #2 ============//
/*Write a fucntion that takes in an array and removes every even index with a splice,
and replaces it with the string "even index" */

let arr1 = ["Max","Baseball","Reboot","Goku","Trucks","Rodger"]

function replaceEvens(arr){
    for(let i =0; i < arr.length; i++){
        if (i % 2 == 0){
            arr.splice(i, 1, "even index")
        }
    }
    console.log(arr)
}
replaceEvens(arr1)




//Expected output
//Given arr == ["Max","Baseball","Reboot","Goku","Trucks","Rodger"]
//Output arr == ["even index","Baseball","even index","Goku","even index","Rodger"]


// ==== Codewars - 1 ====
// ==== You're a square - 7kyu ====


// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false
// isSquare (-1) // => false
// isSquare   3  // => false
// isSquare   4  // => true
// isSquare  25  // => true
// isSquare  26  // => false


var isSquare = function(n){
    return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0;
    }



// ==== Codewars - 2 ====
// ==== Descending Order - 7kyu ====

// Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument
// and return it with its digits in descending order.
// Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

// Examples:
// Input: 42145 Output: 54421

// Input: 145263 Output: 654321

// Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

function descendingOrder(n){
    let n2 = n.toString().split('').sort(function (a,b) {return b-a;}).join('')
    return n2
  }

console.log(descendingOrder(42145))
